This page contains all of the following resources for each class meeting: 

<ul class="icon-list">
  <li> <i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> **Content** materials contains suggested readings, more details about assignments, math appendices, and other helpful resources. I suggest you view these **before** each class.</li>
  <li><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> **Slides** directly link to the  "[Xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)" presentations in html that can be opened in any browser (You can find a downloadable PDF in each respective **content** page)</li>
  <li><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> **Assignments** are listed with due dates</li>
</ul>

Please note that the lesson numbers, topics, and titles (e.g. 1.1) are *my* design, and do not match up with the textbook!

Relevant materials, if applicable will be posted before class meets and become colored links.
