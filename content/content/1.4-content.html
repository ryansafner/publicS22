<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>We are going to take a brief detour in an area of applied microeconomics known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm">“Theory of the Firm.”</a>. This area itself could take weeks to properly study — indeed in my <a href="https://ios20.classes.ryansafner.com/schedule">Industrial Organization course</a> I spend about 3 weeks on this topic — and a number of Nobel prizes in economics (most recently to <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2016/press-release/">Hart and Holmström in 2016</a>). However, we study it for several reasons: to consider situations where team production is required to provide a valuable good, to consider why organization with inherent hierarchy may be necessary, and to consider new economic problems that any organization brings along with it.</p>
<p>While there are several contested theories of the firm (and the original goes back to a 1937 paper by Coase!), one of the most famous and fruitful is known as the “nexus of contract theory,” which originates in a famous 1972 paper by Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz, which is your required reading.</p>

<div id="questions-to-guide-your-reading" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions to Guide Your Reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Do firms exist in traditional economic models of production?</p></li>
<li><p>If markets are so great at allocating resources, why do firms exist?</p></li>
<li><p>When and why must we resort to hierarchy and command and control systems?</p></li>
<li><p>What do Alchian and Demsetz mean that a firm has no more power or authority than you or I do in the marketplace? Do you agree?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the fundamental economic problem with team production?</p></li>
<li><p>What new economic problems does the hiring of a monitor, an agent, or the establishment of a firm create?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference between a firm and other organizations? Like clubs? Like States?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
