<h2>Appendix: Spatial Competition Analysis in Multiple-Issue Dimensions</h2>
<p>In class, we looked at spatial competition along a single dimension, and saw that <strong>if preferences are single-peaked</strong>, the <strong>median</strong> platform will win a majority, and escape the problem of cycling.</p>
<p>Suppose we have three voters again voting on a platform of <strong>two</strong> issues: (1) Education Spending and (2) Defense Spending.</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We represent their <strong>ideal points</strong> in 2-dimensional issue space in the figure above. Imagine this is looking down on the peaks of three mountains, as moving in <em>any direction</em> away from a voter’s ideal point (peak) decreases their utility (if you like, decreases in elevation from the peak).</p>
<p>Now, we can still apply the median voter theorem here, by determining the median of each issue. For Education Spending, C is the median (A to the left and C to the right), and for Defense Spending, B is the median (A above, and C below).</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We have found the median platform by combining the median of each issue. Now, find the distance, for each voter, from their ideal point to the median platform. Consider this a distance the radius of a circle. This circle, for each voter, represents an <strong>indifference curve</strong> for that voter: the set of alternative platforms of education and defense that is <em>equally preferable</em> (gives same utility) for that voter as the median platform.</p>
<p><em>Inside</em> each circle is the set of platforms that are <strong>preferred over</strong> the median (and equivalent platforms, the circumference of the circle). As an obvious demonstration, each voter prefers their own ideal point (A prefers A, B prefers B, and C prefers C) over the median platform.</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note the “preferred-to sets” (the shaded circles) <strong>do not overlap</strong> at the median! The borders of the circles do, i.e. the indifference curve, but not the preferred-to sets!</p>
<p>Now, allow the voters to propose any platform they wish, to vote on in a pairwise vote. We begin with the median as a starting point: ($50B Education Spending, $50B Defense Spending).</p>
<p>Consider voter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. She could propose something she prefers over the median, say point <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> at ($30, $70), but that is outside the other voters’ preferred-to sets (outside of their circles), so this would be <strong>worse</strong> for them, and they would vote against it.</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> proposes something inside her and any other voter’s preferred-to set (inside the circle), she can get a majority to approve it over the median. Suppose she proposes platform <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>: $35B education and $42.5 B defense. Then her and voter <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> will vote for this over the median, since it is inside both of their circles (and thus, preferred over the median), whereas <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will vote against it, it being worse than the median.</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
Platform <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> wins, 2-1. Suppose voter <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> suggests an alternative to <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, platform <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, with $58B in Education and $33B in Defense. Compared to platform <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, voters <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> prefer this, as it is closer to their ideal points, but it is well outside voter <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>’s circle, so she votes against. But the vote of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> results in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> winning, 2-1.</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> counters proposal <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> with a new proposal, <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>: $55B in Education, $58B in Defense. Now <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> prefer this to proposal <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, while <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> votes against it. Measure <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> passes, 2-1:</p>
<p><img src="/content/3.1-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we see that, in multi-issue space, <strong>we get cycling</strong>! Any voter can propose a platform that can capture a majority<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and any voter can then propose an alternative platform that can also capture a majority for the alternative platform and against the first platform!</p>
<p>This is sometimes called the <strong>Chaos Theorem</strong> in social choice theory: in multi-dimensional policy space, even with single-peaked preferences<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, there are no Condorcet winners, and thus a majority opposes each alternative. We can reach <strong>any</strong> point in this space with a carefully-constructed sequence of votes. Thus, again, there is no “will of the majority” and an agenda-setter can achieve any outcome they want.</p>
<p>The Median Voter Theorem worked in a single dimension with single-peaked preferences. The result we see here, in multiple issue space (and generalized by Arrow’s impossibility theorem), is that cycling is not easily solved: the median voter theorem fails when there are multiple issues.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
