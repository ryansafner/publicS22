<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>After we’ve digested some political philosophy (with a dose of game theory), it’s time for a more “rigorous” model of choosing as a group. How should we decide how to decide?</p>
<p>We read the key chapters of Buchanan and Tullock’s classic 1962 <em>Calculus of Consent</em>, which (mostly) launched the field of public choice as the economic analysis of politics. Buchanan won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1986 for his contributions to this field.</p>

<li><i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Buchanan and Tullock (1962), <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/buchanan-the-calculus-of-consent-logical-foundations-of-constitutional-democracy"><em>The Calculus of Consent</em></a>, Chs. 3,5,6</li>
<li><i class="fa-external-link-square-alt"></i> <a href="https://ryansafner.shinyapps.io/ccmodel/">Calculus of Consent Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapters 3 and 5 set up Buchanan and Tullock to talk about their subject — politics and constitutions — using economic analysis. It may seem a bit dry and excessive but remember, in 1962 almost nobody else thought politics could (or should) be analyzed with economic tools and assumptions like self-interested behavior! You can skim these chapters mostly, but focus on chapter 6 more closely, this is their actual model.</p>
<div id="questions-to-guide-your-reading" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions to Guide Your Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>“When will a society composed of free and rational utility-maximizing individuals choose to undertake action collectively rather than privately?”</p></li>
<li><p>How do we determine the rules that will determine the rules by which we choose as a group?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the moral significance, or special status, if any, of majority rule, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{2}+1\)</span> for deciding something?</p></li>
<li><p>When/why is unanimity important? When might it make rational sense to depart from unanimity as a decision rule?</p></li>
<li><p>What sorts of decisions should require more agreement, and what sorts of decisions should require less agreement?</p></li>
<li><p>How is the optimal decision rule deduced?</p></li>
<li><p>Should majorities decide everything? Why or why not?</p></li>

<h2><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides</h2>
<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
