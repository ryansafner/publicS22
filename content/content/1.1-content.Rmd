## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

<span class="newthought">Welcome</span> to ECON 317 — Economic Development! Today's lesson will be an overview of the content and the assignments of the course. Please read and familiarize yourself with the [syllabus](/syllabus).

This is not just a “syllabus day,” as we need to hit the ground running, but today will give you a “big picture” look at this semester by starting with some of the biggest questions, not just in "development economics" or "economics," but arguably all of social science:

1. Why are some countries wealthy, and others poor?
2. How did/do countries become wealthy?

We then also consider the history “development economics” as a self-identifying field of economics, as compared to the original motivations for economics or political economy (in Adam Smith's time) as a discipline.

Today is introductory, but please heed this timeless message:

Please note going forward, the lesson numbers and topics (e.g. 1.1) on this website are *my* design, and will not match up with any books!

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.

The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
