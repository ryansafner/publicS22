## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

<span class="newthought">Welcome</span> to ECON 410 — Public Economics! Today's lesson will be an overview of the content and the assignments of the course. Please read and familiarize yourself with the [syllabus](/syllabus).

This is not just a “syllabus day,” as we need to hit the ground running, but today will give you a “big picture” look at this semester by reflecting on the overarching question this semester: **how do we choose in groups?**

## <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-lg"></i> Readings

Today is introductory, but please heed this timeless message:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message to students from the Doggfather himself, <a href="https://twitter.com/SnoopDogg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SnoopDogg</a> <a href="https://t.co/wsSANYv8u6">pic.twitter.com/wsSANYv8u6</a></p>&mdash; Ryan Briggs (@ryancbriggs) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryancbriggs/status/1293543531496308736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Please note going forward, the lesson numbers and topics (e.g. 1.1) on this website are *my* design, and will not match up with any books!

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.

The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
