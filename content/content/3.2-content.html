<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>Today we will discuss the (in)famous concept of <strong>rational ignorance</strong>, as well as <strong>rational irrationality</strong>. Your reading for today is on the latter, since it is more debatable, and since I can explain the former to you very quickly in class (and give a demonstration).</p>
<p>This is a good summary of the argument made by Caplan’s similarly-titled full-length book: <em>The Myth of the Rational Voter, Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies</em>. Feel free to skim the last few sections, once you get the idea about what the biases Caplan argues are.</p>

<h3>Required Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="/readings/Caplan-2007.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Caplan (2007), “The Myth of the Rational Voter”</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="recommended-reading" class="section level3">
<h3>Recommended Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><i class="fas fas fa-book"></i> Holcombe (2016), <em>Advanced Introduction to Public Choice</em>, Chs. 6</li>
<li><a href="/readings/Somin-2004.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Somin (2004), “When Ignorance Isn’t Bliss”</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Your Holcombe “textbook” does discuss both rational ignorance, voter turnout, and rational irrationality in this brief chapter.</p>
<p>Somin’s piece goes into more detail specifically about the concept of rational ignorance (and he has several recent books on the topic).</p>
</div>
<div id="questions-to-guide-your-reading" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions to Guide Your Reading</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>According to Caplan, what are the four systematic biases?</p></li>
<li><p>What is “rational ignorance”?</p></li>
<li><p>What is Caplan’s idea of “rational irrationality” and how is it different from “rational ignorance?”</p></li>
<li><p>How does the Median Voter Theorem fit into Caplan’s framework?</p></li>
<li><p>What is “the miracle of aggregation,” how does it work, and why does Caplan argue it is not relevant for voting?</p></li>
<li><p>Why do people vote or not vote? How do people that do vote choose how they vote?</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides</h2>
<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
