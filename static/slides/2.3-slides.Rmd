# The Story So Far

We need to .hi[create a State to constrain individuals] from interfering against one another...but .hi[we also need to constrain the State]

- .hi[Constitutional rules] define the .hi-purple[domain of allowed collective decisions] and the .hi-purple[rules or procedures] for doing so

- Their practical function is .hi-purple[to protect minorities from the majority]

# What Affects Total Costs

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Size of $N$: larger groups create larger $C+D$ costs
  - .hi-purple[We want the smallest group consistent with the size of the externality]

- Heterogeneity (of preferences, wealth, power, etc)
  - $C$-costs rise: greater fear of being in minority
  - $D$-costs rise: harder to get very different people to agree

# Comparing the Cure and the Disease

.pull-left[

- Different alternative decisions regarding an externality have different costs:

- $A$: do nothing, live with externality

- $B$: voluntary collective action
  - cost of collective action might yield underprovision

- $C$: government action
  - cost of collective action might create *new* political externalities

- Even with optimal collective decision rule, it might be better off left to private hands if total costs are lower (at A)

- In general, the higher $C+D$ costs are (for whatever reason), the greater likelihood that an activity should be left private

# The Importance of the Starting Point

.pull-left[

- Constitutional choice does not take place in a vacuum

- Veil of ignorance assumes we have no specific stake in changing rules in a particular way, but 

- Our current political situation (preferences, wealth, power, etc.) naturally will affect how we view different rules

# The Importance of the Starting Point

.pull-left[

- Incorrect to start from Hobbes (no rules); irrelevant to our actual decisions

- Constitutional economics is practically about *reform* of rules, rather than designing from scratch 

- We must always start from where we are

- We would build a different house from scratch than if we change our existing one
