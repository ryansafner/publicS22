&gt; "EVERYBODY is talkin' these days about Tammany men growin' rich on graft, but nobody thinks of drawin' the distinction between honest graft and dishonest graft. There's all the difference in the world between the two. Yes, many of our men have grown rich in politics. I have myself. I've made a big fortune out of the game, and I'm gettin' richer every day, but I've not gone in for dishonest graft—blackmailin' gamblers, saloonkeepers, disorderly people, etc.—and neither has any of the men who have made big fortunes in politics.

&gt; There's an honest graft, and I'm an example of how it works. I might sum up the whole thing by sayin': "I seen my opportunities and I took 'em."

"[Reformers] mean well but [they] don't know how to make distinctions. [They] can't see no difference between honest graft and dishonest graft and, consequent, [they get] things all mixed up. There's the biggest kind of a difference between political looters and politicians who make a fortune out of politics by keepin' their eyes wide open. The looter goes in for himself alone without considerin' his organization or his city. The politician looks after his own interests, the organization's interests, and the city's interests all at the same time. See the distinction? For instance, I ain't no looter. The looter hogs it. I never hogged. I made my pile in politics, but, at the same time, I served the organization and got more big improvements for New York City than any other livin' man. And I never monkeyed with the penal code."

&gt; "The politicos of our grandparents’ generation did a pretty good job of governing the country, despite living in a world of bosses and back rooms and unlimited donations, and many of them understood some home truths which today’s political reformers have too often overlooked or suppressed. In particular, they understood that transactional politics—the everyday give-and-take of dickering and compromise—is the essential work of governing and that government, and thus democracy, won’t work if leaders can’t make deals and make them stick," (pp.1-2).

&gt; "[P]rogressive, populist, and libertarian reformers joined forces to wage a decades-long war against machine politics by weakening political insiders' control of money, nominations, negotiations, and other essential tools of political leadership.

&gt; "[R]eformers' fixations on corruption and participation, although perhaps appropriate a long time ago, have become destabilizing and counterproductive, contributing to the rise of privatized psuedomachines that make governing more difficult and politics less accountable," (p.2).

&gt; "Most generally, the amateur believes that political parties ought to be programmatic, internally democratic, and largely or entirely free of a reliance on material incentives such as patronage. A programmatic party would offer a real policy alternative to the opposition party. A vote for the party would be as much, or more, a deliberate vote for a set of clear and specific proposals, linked by a common point of view or philosophy of government, as it would be for a vote for a set of leaders. The programmatic basis of one party would, to some extent, compel an expression of purpose by the opposing party and thus lead toward the realignment of both parties nationally, with liberals in one and conservatives in the other," (p.358).

For the populist reformer, the solution to almost any political problem involves more democracy, more participation, and more power for the little guy. Populism turns the progressive activist's instinctive suspicion of political insiders and careerists into an explicit ideology: by their very nature, political professionals are interlopers who speak for special interests and the political class; amateurs are the true custodians of the public interest" (p.16).

&gt; "A crucial premise of populist reform, namely that most people want to participate more in politics, turns out to be wrong. And so, instead of opening decisionmaking to a broader, more diverse, and more representative spectrum than party hacks represented, primaries have skewed decisionmaking toward the notably narrow, ideologically-extreme, and decidedly nonrepresentative sliver of voters who turn out in primary elections," (p.19).

&gt; "[I]n the 1970s, [a second wave of progressive reformers] established a web of legalistic rules and regulations which have made it much harder for candidates and parties to raise money, on the general theory that fundraising and dependence on big-dollar donors are inherently corrupting. The result was not to reduce the amount of money in politics or to reduce the influence of special interests but to drive money to unrestricted channels, such as party committees. When progressive legislation restricted those channels too, the result was to push money into so-called 'independent' spending by super PACS, nonprofit organizations, billionaires, and other actors who are less accountable, less pragmatic, and less transparant than Tammany ever was," (p.19).

&gt; "One important attribute of smoke-filled rooms was that usually you had a pretty good idea who was entiteld to be in them - and the selection, to the dismay of [progressives and populists], was not always based on merit. To the contrary, political leaders delegated deal-making to functionaries who had earned a place at the table by dint of seniority, loyalty, or cunning, as well as expertise. Keeping freelancers and interlopers out of the room and maintaining control over the agenda inside the room are instrumental to making bargaining manageable and delivering on deals; giving loyalists and time-servers a place at the table rewards them and marginalizes outsiders," (p.21-22).

# Reformers' Target: Pork

&gt; "And then there are earmarks and pork. For years they were the hard currency of Capitol Hill's political economy. Sometimes abused, they could also be a powerful inducement to win a waivering vote or break an impasse. Lyndon Johnson famously won critical support for the 1964 Civil Rights Act by 'proposing, and personally securing, a NASA research facility at Purdue University,' in the district of House Republican leader Charles Halleck of Indiana. Pork remains alive but earmarks were banned in 2010 under pressue from Tea Partiers, who saw them as emblematic of Washington corruption...Their abolition stripped leaders on the Hill of one of the few tools still remaining to them for influencing behavior. Avoiding a government shutdown in 2013 would have 'absolutely' been easier if House Speaker Boehner had been able to dispense earmarks," (p.23).
