&gt; “.hi[A primary function of property rights is that of guiding incentives to achieve a greater internalization of externalities]. Every cost and benefit associated with social interdependencies is a potential externality. One condition is necessary to make costs and benefits [become] externalities. The cost of a transaction in the rights between the parties (internalization) must exceed the gains from internalization. In general, transacting cost can be large relative to gains because of ‘natural’ difficulties in trading or they can be large because of legal reasons,” (p.348).

&gt; “Before the fur trade became established, hunting was carried on primarily for purposes of food and the relatively few furs that were required for the hunter’s family.  The externality was clearly present...but these external effects were of such small significance that it did not pay for anyone to take them into account.” (p.351).

&gt; “[T]he advent of the fur trade had two immediate consequences. First, the value of furs to the Indians was increased considerably. Second, and as a result, the scale of hunting activity rose sharply. Both consequences must have increased considerably the importance of the externalities associated with free hunting. The property right system began to change.”

&gt; “[Algonkians and Iroquois] divide themselves into several bands in order to hunt more efficiently. It was their custom...to appropriate pieces of land about two leagues square for each group to hunt exclusively. Ownership of beaver houses, however, had already become established, and when discovered, they were marked. A starving Indian could kill and eat another's beaver if he left the fur and the tail.”

&gt; “The principle of the Indians is to mark off the hunting ground selected by them Dy blazing the trees with their crests so that they may never encroach on each other...By the middle of the century these allotted territories were relatively stabilized,” (p.352).

&gt; “If market transactions were costless, all that matters (questions of equity apart) is that the rights of the various parties should be well-defined and the results of legal actions easy to forecast.

&gt; “In such cases, the courts directly influence economic activity.”
