  - .hi[Sacrifice]: members invest in costly &amp; observable behavior: wear particular outfits, attend meetings, learn rituals, pay dues, eat particular diet, etc.
  - .hi[Stigma]: members who don’t contribute or make the sacrifice are shamed &amp; ostracized (or kicked out)

&gt; “No general theory has been developed which covers the whole spectrum of ownership-consumption possibilities, ranging from the purely private or individualized activity on the one hand to purely public or collectivized activity on the other. One of the missing links here is ‘a theory of clubs’, a theory of co-operative membership, a theory that will include as a variable to be determined the extension of ownership-consumption rights over differing numbers of persons,” (p.1).

This construction allows us to move one step forward in closing the awesome Samuelson gap between the purely private and the purely public good. For the former, the  optimal sharing arrangement, the preferred club membership, is clearly one person (or one family unit), whereas the optimal sharing group for the purely public good, as defined in the polar sense, includes an infinitely large number of members,” (pp.1-2).

2. .hi-purple[Utilization] (of capacity): charge optimal fee where **MB** of member from consumption **= MC** of congestion imposed on other members
    - too low a fee creates too much congestion/overutilized; underutilized if too high

3. .hi-purple[Membership]: new members added until **MB** of membership (lower per person cost for members) **= MC** additional congestion costs from greater size of membership
