> “There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent. This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts...Apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always binds all the rest. This follows from the contract itself. But it is asked how can a man be both free and subject to wills not his own. How are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to?”

> “I retort that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives his consent to all laws, including those which are passed in spite of his opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break any of them,” (Book IV, Ch. 2, “Voting”),

This means nothing less than that he will be forced to be free]; for this is the condition which, by giving each citizen to his country, secures him against all personal dependence. In this lies the key to the working of the political machine; this alone legitimises civil undertakings, which, without it, would be absurd, tyrannical, and liable to the most frightful abuses,” (Book I, Ch. 7).

Therefore, when motorists meet at an intersection, they stop to compare destinations and ascertain which of them is more worthy of having the right of way. If you attend our high school track meet tomorrow night, you’ll see it’s the same thing. Instead of awarding gold medals for running the fastest, we award them for giving the greatest effort. Anyway, that’s why the other cars honked, because you didn’t stop to compare destinations.” The cop paused, stared, silently.
