The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed. The law emodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics. In order to know what it is, we must know what it has been, and what it tends to become...The substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then understood to be convenient; but its form and machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results, depend very much upon its past.”

> “Private sales, and other private contracts, carry legal sanctions for nonperformance...But there are no legal sanctions for the failure of a legislature to carry oout its ‘bargain...’ There is no legal mechanism analogous to a binding long-term contract by which the enacting Congress can prevent a subsequent Congress fromo amending the legislation in a way unfavorable to [special interests], or indeed fromo repealing it altogether.” (p.877)

> “Legislation is not self-enforcing, however. If the people subject to a law refuse to obey it, recourse to the courts i snecessary to enforce the law. A judiciary that was subservient to the current membership of the legislature could nullify legislation enacted in a previous session of the legislature. Suppose that Congress in uyear one ‘sells’ the dairy industry a heavy tax on margarine, but the next year the producers of margarine offer Congress generous inducements ot remove the tax. Congress is unlikely to respond to this demand by enacting repealing legislation...but if the judges are the perfect agents of the current Congress, they will refuse to enforce the margarine tax, the effect will be the same as legislative repeal.”

- Consider now if Congress could enforce this legislation permanently (and never repeal)

- Much more special interest legislation gets passed (more profitable)

- “Thus, the legislature has powerful incentives to devise methods of increasing the permanency of legislation.”

- “If, however, the judges served at the pleasure of the legislatures, their decisions would presumably be in perfect harmony with the current legislature’s wishes, and we would be hack to the single-period model [Demand 1]” (882).

- “If the judiciary is independent, it can be expected...to enforce existing statutes in accordance with the intent of the enacting legislature...an independent judiciary thus turns out to be an ingenious device for promoting the sale of long-term special interest legislation [Demand 2], independence is not without its costs. The judiciary may decide not to enforce the deal worked out by the legislature. It may declare the law unconstitutional or interpret it in a manner that reduces the gains from the law to the group intended to benefit from it, since most sitting judges, having been appointed in an earlier period, will ‘owe’ nothing to the enacting legislature.” (883)

- “The cost of independence is shown...by the demand curve [Demand 3], which is lower than [Demand 2]. The difference between the two curves is due to the positive probability in each future period that the returns from the special-interest legislation will not be forthcoming because of adverse judicial rulings. These expectations will be incorporated into the maximum price that groups are willing to pay for favorable legislation.” (883)
