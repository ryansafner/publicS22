&gt; “There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent. This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts...Apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always binds all the rest. This follows from the contract itself. But it is asked how can a man be both free and subject to wills not his own. How are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to?”

&gt; “I retort that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives his consent to all laws, including those which are passed in spite of his opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break any of them,” (Book IV, Ch. 2, “Voting”),

&gt; “In order then that the social compact may not be an empty formula, it tacitly includes the undertaking, which alone can give force to the rest, that .hi[whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled to do so by the whole body. This means nothing less than that he will be forced to be free]; for this is the condition which, by giving each citizen to his country, secures him against all personal dependence. In this lies the key to the working of the political machine; this alone legitimises civil undertakings, which, without it, would be absurd, tyrannical, and liable to the most frightful abuses,” (Book I, Ch. 7).

&gt; “I couldn’t live without the Relatively Absolute Absolutes. It gets me out of lot o fjams. It gets me off of lot of hooks, too! But it’s a concept...that I picked up directly from Frank Knight and Henry Simons...It prevents the necessity of taking a position either as a relativist in all respects or as an absolutist. I am neither...it’s an in-between position.”

&gt; “There are some moral values that have been in existence a long time, that have been proved by the test of history. [It] is best to live our ordinary lives by treating those as ‘relatively absolute absolutes’”

&gt; “[But] they are not beyond examination; nothing is sacrosanct. At one level of our existence you can evaluate those, you can say ‘are they really as stable, authoritative, or unchallengeable as they might seem?’ We can challenge them in the academy; that’s the job of the academy...But atthe same time that is not just going out and saying ‘anything goes,’at all. So it gets you off that terrible problem of becoming [a relativist or anabsolutist in moral theory]. I am neither.”

# The Utility of Keeping Unjust Rules

.quitesmall[
&gt; I pulled over. The cop pulled in behind. Walked to my window, peered inside, asked for my license and registration. 

&gt; “New in town?”

&gt; Yes, I said. Got in five minutes ago.

&gt; “Know what you did wrong?” 

&gt; “Sorry. There was no stop sign or stop light. The cars on the cross street were stopped, so I kept going.” 

&gt; The cop shook his head. “In this town, sir, we distribute according to desert. Therefore, when motorists meet at an intersection, they stop to compare destinations and ascertain which of them is more worthy of having the right of way. If you attend our high school track meet tomorrow night, you’ll see it’s the same thing. Instead of awarding gold medals for running the fastest, we award them for giving the greatest effort. Anyway, that’s why the other cars honked, because you didn’t stop to compare destinations.” The cop paused, stared, silently.

&gt; “I’m sorry, Officer” I said at last. “I know you must be joking, but I’m afraid I don’t get it.”

&gt; “Justice isn’t a joke, sir. I was going to let you off with a warning. Until you said that.” (2006, 31)
