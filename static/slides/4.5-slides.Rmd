> “As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land,” (Book I, Chapter XI)

All over the world we hear complaints of...labor condemned to involuntary idleness; capital going to waste...Where do we find the deepest poverty, the hardest struggle for existence, the greatest enforced idleness? Why, wherever material progress is most advanced...This relation of poverty to progress is the great question of our time.”

  - tax the *full* value (100%) of rent needed to occupy *land*

> "We laid out a fancificul version of this approach...all property - every factory, house, and car - is held in common and the right to rent and use it is constantly auctioned. The citizen who offers the highest bid (in the form of a rental payment) possesses the object until outbid by another citizen. Each factory, house, or car would have a standing highest bid placedo n it, representing the rent that the current possessor agreed to pay to the government for using the asset. Anyone could beat this bid and claim the object. The money collected from rents is used to finance public goods...and fund a social dividend," (p.49).

This system is simple, self-enforcing, allows no scope for corruption, has negligible cost of administration, and creates incentives, in addition to those already present in the market, for each property to be put to that use in which it has the highest economic productivity," (p.57).

About half of that money would suffice to eliminate all existing taxes on capital, corporations, property, and inheritance, which economists agree are highly inefficient...[and] to wipe out the budget deficit and significantly reduce debt...
