- .hi[Constitutional rules] define the .hi-purple[domain of allowed collective decisions] and the .hi-purple[rules or procedures] for doing so

- Their practical function is .hi-purple[to protect minorities from the majority]

&gt; The view that now pervades much public policy economics implicitly presents the relevant choice as between an ideal norm and an existing 'imperfect' institutional arrangement.
