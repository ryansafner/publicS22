# What's Wrong With 1P1V?

- The bedrock of democracy is the idea of .hi[One person, one vote (1p1v)]

# What's Wrong With 1P1V: Ordinality

- Voting systems give equal weight to preferences by person

- No way to differentiate **preferences** or **intensities**
  - Only .hi-purple[ordinal rankings]: $A > B$ or $A < B$

- But this ruling is going to be determined by **votes**, not market prices or transactions

- Under 1p1v, marginal cost of "buying" votes is constant

    - most votes you could buy with $x$ is $\sqrt{x}$

- For each issue, individual can expend $x$ $Q$-credits to cast $\sqrt{x}$ votes

- $Q$-credits "rollover" if not spent on issues

- Can save credits for issues you care more about
