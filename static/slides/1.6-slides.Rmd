- Alfred Marshall: in a competitive market, an “economic rent” depends on:

1. **Time-period**: 
  - Short run: inelastic factors (like capital) earn .hi-purple[quasi—rents] due to their being fixed
  - Long run: these returns normalize to market return (zero excess profits)

2. **Point of view**:
  - Firm’s point of view: these are **costs of production** that must be paid; and **price-determined**, i.e. rents must rise via competition to make dissipate profits to 0
  - Society’s point of view: some factors really are fixed, and may earn excess returns that are **price-determining**, i.e. demand for fixed factor sets a high price

# The Allocation of Talent Matters I

> "A country's most talented people typically organize production by others, so they can spread their ability advantage over a larger scale. When they start firms, they innovate and foster growth, but when they become rent seekers, they only redistribute wealth and reduce growth. Occupational choice depends on returns to ability and to scale in each sector, on market size, and on compensation contracts. In most countries, rent seeking rewards talent more than entrepreneurship does, leading to stagnation. Our evidence shows that countries with a higher proportion of engineering college majors grows faster; wheras countries with a higher proportion of law concentrators grow more slowly," (p. 503)

> "The particular circumstance we emphasize as likely to produce a serious threat of this type of reneging on contracts is the presence of appropriable specialized quasi rents. After a specific investment is made and such quasi rents are created, the possibility of opportunistic behavior is very real. Following Coase's framework, this problem can be solved in two possible ways: vertical integration or contracts," (p.298)

> "An appropriable quasi rent is not a monopoly rent in the usual sense, that is, the increased value of an asset protected from market entry over the value it would have in an open market. [It] can occur with no market closure or restrictions placed on rival assets. Once installed, an asset may be so expensive to remove or so specialized to a particular user that if the price paid to the owner was somehow reduced the asset's services to that user would not be reduced," (p.299).

"The manufacture of dies for stamping parts in accordance with the above specifications [for a Mustang or Ford model] gives a value to these dies specialized to Ford, which implies an appropriable quasi rent in those dies...once the large sunk fixed cost of the specific investment in the dies is made, the incentive for Ford to opportunistically renegotiate a lower price at which it will accept body parts from the independent die owner may be large. Similarly, if there is a large cost to Ford from the production delay of obtaining an alternative supplier of the specific body parts, the independent die owner may be able to capture quasi rents by demanding a revised higher price for the parts. Since the opportunity to lose the specialized quasi rent of assets is a debilitating prospect, neither party would invest in such equipment. Joint ownership of designs and dies removes this incentive to attempt appropriation," (p.308).

In order to encourage Fisher Body to make the required specific investment, this contract had an exclusive dealing clause whereby General Motors agreed to buy substantially all its closed bodies from Fisher. This exclusive dealing arrangement significantly reduced the possibility of General Motors acting opportunistically by demanding a lower price for the bodies after Fisher made the specific investment in production capacity,"

The demand conditions facing General Motors and Fisher Body changed dramatically over the next few years.

Meanwhile, General Motors was very unhappy with the price it was being charged by its now very important supplier, Fisher...By 1924, General Motors had found the Fisher contractual relationship intolerable and began negotiations for purchase of the remaining stock in Fisher Body, culminating in a final merger agreement in 1926," (pp.309-310).
