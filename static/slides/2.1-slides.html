# Recap: The Story So Far

.pull-left[
.smaller[
- Markets face problems with:
  - Externalities (Coase, Demsetz)
  - Public goods, common resources (Olson, Ostrom)
  - High transaction costs

- There are situations where we may want to act collectively
  - Providing public goods, club goods, common pool resources
  - Defining property rights
  - Achieving justice

# Choosing in Groups, Creating Politics

- **A group must make a choice to determine a single outcome that affects all individuals**

# Choosing in Groups, Creating Politics

.pull-left[

- Easy when each member has the same preference for an outcome, then “we” prefer that outcome
  - e.g. I prefer `\(A \succ B\)`,
  - you prefer `\(A \succ B\)`,
  - she prefers `\(A \succ B\)`,
  - so “we” prefer `\(A \succ B\)`

# Choosing in Groups, Creating Politics

.pull-left[
- But what if we (likely) disagree?
  - Need some procedure to aggregate our individual preferences into a single group preference

- In this case, .hi-turquoise[many (perhaps even most) members will disagree with the outcome chosen by the group]

- .hi-purple[How/why are individuals members of a group obliged to accept the choice of the group, even when they disagree with it]

# Constituting a Group

.pull-left[

- Very important then to consider how groups .hi[constitute] themselves: .hi-purple[deciding how to decide]

- The Greek word commonly translated as “constitution” is *politea*, more like the “soul” of a group
  - self-identified identities, rights and obligations of citizens, a polis, etc.

- Difference between a bunch of individuals and a *group*

Or shall we say that the generßations of men, like the rivers, are the same, but that the state changes? For, since the state is a partnership, and is a partnership of citizens in a constitution, when the form of government changes, and becomes different, then it may be supposed that the state is no longer the same...And if this is true it is evident that the *sameness of the state consists chiefly in the sameness of the constitution* [politea], and it may be called or not called by the same name, whether the inhabitants are the same or entirely different,” (Book III, Part I).

- Need not be formal, or written down

3. .hi[Collective domain]: rules to define and limit the scope of what the group may or may not demand of or do to its members (What is *mine* vs. *ours*)
4. .hi[Decision rules]: rules for deciding how to decide normal business for the group choosing outcomes or policies
5. .hi[Citizenship obligations]: rules to define and limit what members can demand of the group
6. .hi[Amendment]: rules for deciding how to decide how to change the rules
7. .hi[Exit]: rules for allowing (or denying) exit from the group

&gt; “There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent. This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts...Apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always binds all the rest. This follows from the contract itself. But it is asked how can a man be both free and subject to wills not his own. How are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to?”

&gt; “I retort that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives his consent to all laws, including those which are passed in spite of his opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break any of them,” (Book IV, Ch. 2, “Voting”),

# Some Useful Definitions

.pull-left[

  - Makes one collective decision for the group, even though many will disagree with the decision

- .hi[Constitution]: set of rules for deciding how and what a group will be able to decide
  - Constitutional rules supersede politics

- .hi[Democracy]: a *particular* decision rule where an outcome is chosen for the group if any `\(\frac{n}{2}+1\)` of its members agree

# Freedom of Association

.pull-left[
- By joining a group, you are consenting to be coerced (to follow outcomes you disagree with), so *very* important how groups are constituted:
  1. We must be able to negotiate and choose (constitutional) *rules* that we can all consent to
  2. Need to have freedom of association, to choose among many groups to join

After a specific investment is made and such quasi rents are created, the possibility of opportunistic behavior is very real.

&gt; "The only way to erect such a common power, as may be able to defend them from the invasion of foreigners, and the injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them in such sort as that by their own industry and by the fruits of the earth they may nourish themselves and live contendely, is .hi[to confer all their power and strength upon one man, or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto one will]:...and therein to submit their wills, everyone one to his will, and their judgments to his judgment," (Ch. XVII).

&gt; "It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man, in such manner as ife every man should say to every man: .hi[I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner]. This done, the multitude so united in one person is called a .hi[COMMONWEALTH]," (Ch. XVII).

# The Hobbesian Solution

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[The State is our commitment device]

- Citizens (in principle) sign a .hi[social contract], i.e. a ".hi[constitution]" that deliberately restricts their liberties

- In each of our interests to give up some liberties that restrict the liberties of others (e.g. theft, violence)

- In exchange, we empower .hi[the State as our agent] to punish those of us that fail to uphold the social contract

&gt; “There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent. This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts...Apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always binds all the rest. This follows from the contract itself. But it is asked how can a man be both free and subject to wills not his own. How are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to?”

&gt; “I retort that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives his consent to all laws, including those which are passed in spite of his opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break any of them,” (Book IV, Ch. 2, “Voting”),
