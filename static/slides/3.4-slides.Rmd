- Recall the .hi[Median Voter Theorem]: politicians are trying to get close to what they believe the median voter wants

- Politicians may have their own honest convictions about issues

- Tradeoff: honest convictions vs. winning (adopting median voter's preferences)
  - Leslie Knope/Josiah Bartlet vs. Frank Underwood
  - **Only winners get to enact their policies!**

.pull-right[
- Consider politics as a market for votes

- Imagine two groups: 
  - Group 1 prefers policy $A \succ B$
  - Group 2 prefers policy $B \succ A$

- In theory, $1$ can persuade $2$ to support $A$ in exchange for some .hi-purple[side payment], i.e. **1 buys 2's vote**

- That transaction would be a **Pareto improvement**! (Or at least, a **Kaldor-Hicks improvement**)

- Both groups are better off: 1 gets policy $A$, 2 is **compensated** by 1

- However, in many cases in politics, this less likely to happen because of **high transaction costs**

- How would such a vote contract be enforceable?
  - No property rights in politics!

- This actually enhances the market for vote trading in Congress
  - provides verification that each side held up their end of the bargain
  
- **Secret ballots** raise transaction costs and prevent agreements or vote trades

- If the three were combined in a single .hi[omnibus bill]:
  - A, B, C form coalition to vote FOR
  - D, E vote AGAINST
