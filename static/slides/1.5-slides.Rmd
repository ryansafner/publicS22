- Groups provide immaterial, “social/spiritual goods”, to individuals

- To be a good member, you must .hi[contribute] to the group and not just be a drain on its resources

- Groups often do some combination of the following to overcome the free rider problem:
  - .hi[Sacrifice]: members invest in costly & observable behavior: wear particular outfits, attend meetings, learn rituals, pay dues, eat particular diet, etc.
  - .hi[Stigma]: members who don’t contribute or make the sacrifice are shamed & ostracized (or kicked out)
