&gt; “As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce. The wood of the forest, the grass of the field, and all the natural fruits of the earth, which, when land was in common, cost the labourer only the trouble of gathering them, come, even to him, to have an additional price fixed upon them. He must then pay for the licence to gather them; and must give up to the landlord a portion of what his labour either collects or produces. This portion, or, what comes to the same thing, the price of this portion, constitutes the rent of land,” (Book I, Chapter XI)

Why, wherever material progress is most advanced...This relation of poverty to progress is the great question of our time.”

- Posner &amp; Weyl: a .hi["Common Ownership Self-Assessed Tax" (COST)]
  - also, the "cost" of holding wealth

- If tax is set approximately equal to the .hi-purple[turnover rate], an owner wishing to change the self-assessed price of her asset:
  - benefit is equal to `\(t \Delta P\)` (to deter a buyer)
  - cost is equal to `\(t \Delta P\)` (have to pay tax on price)
  - .hi-purple[has incentive to bid their true valuation]

- .hi-purple[Maximizes allocative efficiency]
  - Only buyers with higher WTP will buy assets from owners

- Recall: .hi-purple[property rights as a bundle of sticks]

- Under COST, an owner is given right to use, and (partial) right to exclude
  - Cannot exclude a higher bidder!

&gt; "We can conceptualize a COST as sharing ownership between society and the possessor. Possessors become lessees from society. Their lease terminates when a higher-value user appears, whereupon the lease is automatically transferred to that user," (p.72).

&gt; "Yet this is not central planning. The government does not set prices, allocate resources, or assign people jobs...[t]he government's role would become more limited than it is today because there would be no need for discretionary interventions, like eminent domain or public ownership of property in the conventional sense, to solve holdout and other monopoly-related problems. There would be much less need for distortionary and discretionary government taxes to raise revenue for the state. Furthermore, control of everything would be radically decentralized...Far from creating a form of centralized planning, the COST creates a new kind of market - a flexible market in uses, to replace the old market based on permanent ownership," (p.72).

&gt; "Every individual and business would have to list each of their possessions in a public register hosted on an online application and enter valuations for each item - or accept default valuations based on the original purchase price or on a database of prices of used goods (like today's Blue Book for used cars) - and would pay an annual tax based on the time-average price they listed over the course of the year. These lessees could change their valuations at any time...," (p.73).

&gt; "Anyone interested in acquiring ('posessing') a specific good would search the databased to find local items of interest. Barcode scanning or photographic recognition software would display the price of something in front of you. By clicking on the item, you transfer funds from your bank account into escrow, and the funds would then bee deposited to the current possessor's account on delivery of the asset. Nondelivery would be penalized as theft," (p.73).

&gt; "As we noted above, the economy underperforms by as much as 25% annually because of the misallocation of resources to low productivity firms. A fully implemented COST could increase social wealth by trillions of dollars every year. Moreover, a COST would raise substantial revenue. At the rate of roughly 7% annually that we imagine being near optimal, a COST would raise roughly 20% of national income. About half of that money would suffice to eliminate all existing taxes on capital, corporations, property, and inheritance, which economists agree are highly inefficient...[and] to wipe out the budget deficit and significantly reduce debt...

&gt; "The other half of COST revenue would be roughly $3,500 per person in the United States...and almost certainly would skyrocket...because of the more efficient allocation of assets...These funds could be used to finance government services, public goods...or social welfare programs for the poor. One could also imagine a system in which the revenue generated by the COST is simply sent back to the population on a per capita basis as a social dividend - akin to the universal basic income, which is currently being touted by leading commentators. In this form, a COST would also serve as a much more effective way to collect a tax on wealth...," (p.80).
