.pull-right[

- Consumers/members/citizens can respond in 3 ways:

1. .hi[“Exit”]: leave the organization (for another)

2. .hi[“Voice”]: influence the organization without leaving (i.e. complain, protest, persuade, lobby)

3. .hi[“Loyalty”]: remain silent, suffer the deterioration

.pull-right[

- Economists focus almost exclusively on .hi[exit]

- Ideal of perfect competition
  - If a firm raises price (suffers high costs), simply switch to one of its countless competitors!

- Exit is **silent**!
  - Requires no confrontation
  - Simply abstain from showing up again!

- In markets, buyers and sellers are *constantly* forming and destroying many relationships
  - "If my grocer does not have what I want, I fire them!"

- Demonstrates only the warning sign of a decline in quality

- .hi-purple[“Alert customers”] have .hi-purple[quality elastic] demand, *very sensitive* to changes in quality
  - These customers will leave at the smallest drop in quality

.pull-right[

- Seems optimal for a firm to have a mix of *both* “alert” and “inert” customers during a decline:

- Alert customers exit and provide the warning sign to firms

- Inert customers stay and provide a “cushion” for firm to stay afloat while rectifying the problem

- Exit and a very competitive marketplace creates a potential problem:

- Hyper quality-conscious buyers always believe they can exit and find a better option
  - “Grass is always greener” illusion

- If every minor decline in quality drives one to search for a better product, one may never stop searching!

- Voice and exit may be **inversely related** in a lot of organizations

- Voice might be used more where exit is not possible

- The stronger voice is, the less likely exit needs to be used
  - Demand will become less elastic with respect to quality
  - i.e. people put up with more if they feel they are being heard

- The weaker voice is (e.g. stifling dissent), more likely exit will be used

&gt; “Suppose at some point, for whatever reason, the public schools deteriorate. Thereupon, increasing numbers of quality-education-conscious parents will send their children to private schools. This "exit" may occasion some impulse toward an improvement of the public schools; but here again this impulse is far less significant than the loss to the public schools of those member-customers who would be most motivated and determined to put up a fight against the deterioration if they did not have the alternative of private schools,” (pp.44-45)

&gt; “When the management of a corporation deteriorates, the first reaction of the best-informed stockholders is to look around for the stock of better-managed companies. In thus orienting themselves toward exit, rather than toward voice, investors are said to follow the Wall Street rule that 'if you do not like the management you should sell your stock." According to a well-known manual this rule 'results in perpetuating bad management and bad policies.' Naturally it is not so much the Wall Street rule that is at fault as the ready availability of alternative investment opportunities in the stock market which makes any resort to voice rather than to exit unthinkable for any but the most committed stockholder,” (p.46)

- **Hirschman**: the reverse can actually be a problem too!

- Users who are *most* quality-sensitive (elastic) will be the first ones to exit and not buy from a deteriorating firm

- These may be the very people who would be the most vocal and demand change!

- Firm is left with least quality-sensitive (inelastic) customers who can tolerate mediocrity

&gt; “Those who hold power in the lazy monopoly may actually have an interest in *creating* some limited opportunities for exit on the part of those whose voice might be uncomfortable,” (p.60).

&gt; “Here is a good illustration of the contrast between the profit-maximizing and the lazy monopolist: the former would engage, if he could, in discriminatory pricing so as to extract maximum revenue from its most avid customers, while the lazy monopolist would much rather price these customers out of the market entirely so as to be able to give up the strenuous and tiresome quest for excellence. For the most avid customers are not only willing to pay the highest prices, but are also likely to be the most demanding and querulous, in case of any lowering standards,” (p.60)

# A Game Theoretic Model: Deterring Predation

- Let's examine the conditions for some lessons on how to deter predation:

1. .hi-red[State] must be dependent on citizens `\((\color{red}{L&gt;1})\)`

2. .hi-blue[Citizens] must have credible .blue[exit] threats `\((\color{blue}{E&gt;0}, \color{blue}{E &gt; 1-c})\)`

3. .blue[Voice] must be costly to .hi-red[State] `\((\color{red}{V&gt;0})\)`
  - But should be cheap for .hi-blue[citizens] to exercise `\((\downarrow \color{blue}{c})\)`
