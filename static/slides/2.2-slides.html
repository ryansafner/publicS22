# The Hobbesian Solution

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[The State is our commitment device]

- Citizens (in principle) sign a .hi[social contract], i.e. a ".hi[constitution]" that deliberately restricts their liberties

- In each of our interests to give up some liberties that restrict the liberties of others (e.g. theft, violence)

- In exchange, we empower .hi[the State as our agent] to punish those of us that fail to uphold the social contract

&gt; “[Those that make the mistake the two] according to the maxims of ancient liberty, demands that the citizens should be entirely subjected in order for the nation to be sovereign, and that the individual should be enslaved for the people to be free.”

&gt; “[They] had mistaken, just as the ancients did, the authority of the social body for liberty...everything was subjected to the empire of the legislator. Every moment of the day was filled by some duty...They believed that everything should give way before the collective will, and that all restrictions on individual rights would be amply compensated by participation in social power.

&gt; “But...where he thinks (as all mankind do who are born under established governments) that by his birth he owes allegiance to a certain prince or certain form of government; it would be absurd to infer a consent or choice, which he expressly, in this case, renounces and disclaims.”

&gt; “Can we seriously say, that a poor peasant or artizan has a free choice to leave his country, when he knows no foreign language or manners, and lives from day to day, by the small wages which he acquires?...We may as well assert, that a man, by remaining in a vessel, freely consents to the dominion of the master; though he was carried on board while asleep, and must leap into the ocean, and perish, the moment he leaves her.”

&gt; “There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent. This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts...Apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always binds all the rest. This follows from the contract itself. But it is asked how can a man be both free and subject to wills not his own. How are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they have not agreed to?”

&gt; “I retort that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives his consent to all laws, including those which are passed in spite of his opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break any of them,” (Book IV, Ch. 2, “Voting”),
