# Courts' Interpretation of Agency Authority

> "What emerged from this period was an implicit bargain: The Court would permit Congress to delegate — and the administrative state to exercise — legislative, executive, and judicial power, but it would review administrative exercises of such power to prevent lawlessness and abuse. Judicial review, then, was substituted for the Constitution's checks and balances as the principal safeguard against the administrative state's becoming despotic."

> "The Commission promulgates substantive rules of conduct. The Commission then considers whether to authorize investigations into whether the Commission’s rules have been violated. If the Commission authorizes an investigation, the investigation is conducted by the Commission, which reports its findings to the Commission. If the Commission thinks that the Commission’s findings warrant an enforcement action, the Commission issues a complaint. The Commission’s complaint that a Commission rule has been violated is then prosecuted by the Commission and adjudicated by the Commission. The Commission adjudication can either take place before the full Commission or before a semi-autonomous Commission administrative law judge. If the Commission chooses to adjudicate before an administrative law judge rather than before the Commission and the decision is adverse to the Commission, the Commission can appeal to the Commission."

> Perhaps your day starts when your clock radio goes off in the morning. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regu-lates not only the airwaves used by your favorite radio station, but also the programming content. Electricity regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and by state regulatory agencies powers your radio. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) regulates the type of light bulb you can use in your lamp.The Consumer Product Safety Commission regulates the label on your mattress. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the content of your toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and other grooming products. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the quality of the water coming out of your showerhead. On your way out of the bathroom, you may have to flush your low-flow toilet twice, a result of mandates imposed by the DOE’s appliance efficiency rules.

# Broad Reach of Regulation

.smaller[

> As you prepare your breakfast, you might check your cere-al’s FDA-regulated label for nutritional information. The FDA also regulates what companies may say about the health bene-fits of foods and what adjectives they may use to describe those health benefits. The FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have a hand in regulating your coffee and sugar. Also joining you for your cup of java is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the hedging of invest-ments in coffee beans, sugar, and other commodities. The EPA, FDA, and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service regulate the fruit you serve for breakfast. The USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service also plays a role in your breakfast. It sets grade standards and purchases fruits and vegetables “to correct supply and demand imbalances,” which keeps prices higher than they otherwise would be. The USDA even regulates the size of the holes in the Swiss cheese you grate into your omelet.
