# Spatial Voting Theory

# Spatial Voting Theory

- We can get a bit more advanced about preferences beyond mere orderings (e.g. `\(A \succ B \succ C)\)`

- Also, ways to avoid cycling

- Consider competition between candidates or proposals in .hi-purple[issue space] (i.e. a range of alternative choices along a single dimension)

# Spatial Voting Theory

Features of Spatial Competition models:

--
1. **Voter preferences are represented by distance**
  - Preferences are "single-peaked" with unique ideal preference
  - Voters prefer candidates or proposals closer to their ideal preference
  - Less distance `\(\implies\)` greater utility

--
2. **Platforms are formed endogenously**
  - Candidates (or proposals) compete *spatially*
  - Want to maximize the number of voters "close" to your platform 

--

- Under these assumptions, a testable prediction about the outcome: .hi[The center (median) of the distribution of preferences is a Condorcet winner]

- Imagine a third candidate, .hi-green[C] on the spectrum

- Again, voters vote for who is closest to them
  - Splits the vote of candidate that is closest to .hi-green[C] (i.e. .hi-blue[A])

- Implication: .hi-purple[Third parties cannot win, and may harm party that they are closest to on issues]

# Implications of Median Voter Theorem

.pull-left[

- Can break voting cycles if preferences on an issue are single-peaked

- .hi-purple[Politics happens at the median], if the median changes, then outcomes changes

- Changes on the fringes have no effect on outcomes

- Candidates that are closer to (further from) the median perform better (worse)

- Third parties split votes and rarely win

# More than One Issue Dimension?

.pull-left[

- We've assumed only a single issue is voted on at a time, with single-peaked preferences

- What if vote is on a bundle of multiple issues?

- Check out class notes later for spatial competition in multiple dimensions

- Long story short: even with single-peaked preferences in multi-issue space, .hi-purple[democracy is indeterminate]

- Want a voting system that meets the following criteria:

1. .hi-purple[Unanimity/Pareto Criterion]: if all individuals prefer `\(X \succ Y\)`, then `\(X\)` must be chosen over `\(Y\)`

2. .hi-purple[Transitivity]: the social choice mechanism is transitive such that if `\(X\)` is chosen over `\(Y\)`, and `\(Y\)` over `\(Z\)`, then `\(X\)` must be chosen over `\(Z\)`

3. .hi-purple[Unrestricted Domain]: all individuals are able to rank all alternatives

4. .hi-purple[Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives]: pairwise comparisons between two alternatives are not affected by the rank of *other* alternatives

5. .hi-purple[Non-dictatorship]: there is no individual that always gets their way regardless of other voters

# Constitutional Rules, Again
